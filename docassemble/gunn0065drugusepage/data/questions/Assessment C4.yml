  **Welcome to the Family Law Lawyer Directory.**

  This application has been developed to help you find and compare Family Law Lawyers in your area.



  **Who We Are**
  
  The Family Law Pathways Network was established in 2003 by the Federal Government, in response to a need for information about family law services to be made available to as many people experiencing separation or engaging with the family law system as possible.

  Funded by the Attorney General’s Department, the Family Law Pathways Network has developed into a coordinated network of professionals and agencies operating within the broader family law system in each State and Territory.

  The overarching aim of the Network is to foster dialogue and collaboration between organisations and professionals to help separating and separated families access appropriate services. The Network encourages collaborative referrals, enhances understanding of available services, and represents an essential component of the Government’s wider commitment to an accessible justice system that meets the needs of Australian families.


  The South Australian Family Law Pathways Network operates under the auspice agency of Relationships Australia SA. This Directory is owned by Relationships Australia SA, but operated entirely by the Senior Coordinator of the Family Law Pathways Network, South Australia.


  All references to “Pathways” means Relationships Australia SA and Family Law Pathways Network, South Australia.
